                    <h4 class = "description"> After taking on facebook I figured I'd take on ESPN, so I made a website for my friends and I to have as an alternative to ESPN Fantasy Sports.  This product was challenging because I wanted to get it done before the draft.  I ended up implementing a draft feature last second and using the website on draft day to keep track of who was available, rather than use a sheet of paper.  I was still a beginner, so I figured I'd avoid any NFL API type deal and just update the stats of star players if I felt like.  I continued to tune up the site during the season.  Once the season was underway, I realized my site didn't have a lot to offer that ESPN didn't other than pretty pictures.  So, I made it personal by creating a power rankings page, and updating where everyone is each week according to me, not the espn standings.  Now, people selfishly had to visit my website to see where they were ranking.  I basically wrote a weekly column and had 11 views each week on it.  The best part about this project was realizing the importance of efficiency.  For example, I had it structured so new fantasy players I hadn't thought of could be inputted by anyone during the season.  Any one could visit the site and create a player.  At first I was using the shell to create players!  Then I was doing so much db work that I created a nice UI for myself to make updates!  I password protected it so now only I can change things.  It was so cool to be able to update my power rankings article without having to redeploy it and hit merge conflicts like the first time I tried which is why my fakebook website is no longer up.  I hope to run this website for years to come with new updates often.  This is probably my best project because a lot of passion was poured into it, and I pulled no punches on the front or back end.</h4>

                    <h4 class = "description"> Lastly we have game design.  During the bootcamp, I was a little ahead of the other students so I taught myself C# and Unity.  I made my first game called Starbros, and had the whole Dojo playing it.  They were addicted and I knew I was onto something.  Later, I dreamt of an interactive portfolio, where the recruiter could play my 3D game and get the information he needs in a more exciting way than looking at another resume.  I brought that dream to life, but my jet did not obey the laws of physics. As I got better at scripting I would go back and tweak the flight mechanics until I made a much better version, the current version.  However, looking at it now I could make it a lot better but I'm focusing on First Person Shooters at the moment.  FPS9 is probably my best game to date simply because I did the whole thing myself with zero help.  I reinvented the wheel with FPS9 rather than using some built in Unity features because I wanted finer tuning.</h4>
