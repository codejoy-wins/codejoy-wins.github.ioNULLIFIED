                    <h4 class = "description"> Lastly we have game design.  During the bootcamp, I was a little ahead of the other students so I taught myself C# and Unity.  I made my first game called Starbros, and had the whole Dojo playing it.  They were addicted and I knew I was onto something.  Later, I dreamt of an interactive portfolio, where the recruiter could play my 3D game and get the information he needs in a more exciting way than looking at another resume.  I brought that dream to life, but my jet did not obey the laws of physics. As I got better at scripting I would go back and tweak the flight mechanics until I made a much better version, the current version.  However, looking at it now I could make it a lot better but I'm focusing on First Person Shooters at the moment.  FPS9 is probably my best game to date simply because I did the whole thing myself with zero help.  I reinvented the wheel with FPS9 rather than using some built in Unity features because I wanted finer tuning.</h4>
